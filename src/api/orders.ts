 *   refunds the whole outstanding balance (the old all-or-nothing behaviour).
 *
 * Sending `status: 'refunded'` records a refund and reverses the matching GST.
 * A PARTIAL amount is allowed and still marks the order 'refunded', so the flag
 * means "a refund was recorded", not "all of it came back" — always render
 * `refunded_amount` next to the status. Re-sending an explicit amount on an
 * already-refunded order records a further partial (refund in instalments).
 * The backend 400s if the amount is non-numeric, <= 0, or exceeds what is
 * still refundable.
 *
 * - `cod_paid` is the "Paid in cash" tick. COD orders only (the backend 400s on
 *   an ONLINE order, so an unpaid gateway order can't be hand-marked settled).
 *   Sending `true` stamps who confirmed it and when, and flips `payment_status`
 *   to 'paid'; `false` reverses a misclick, and is refused once a refund has
 *   been recorded against the payment. A COD order must be ticked BEFORE it can
 *   be refunded — without proof cash arrived, a refund would reverse GST on
